# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [5.2.0] - 2024-08-10

- The Docker images with `-tidy` tags are no longer supported. Please switch to `-alpine` images.
- Weâ€™re working on improving build speed and resource efficiency.
- Our new workflow creates two types of Docker images: stable images and development images (with `dev-` tags).
- Weâ€™ve stopped maintaining Docker images for Crater, FuelPHP, and PHPixie due to their inactive development.

## [5.1.0] - 2024-08-01

We have updated the behavior of the environment variables used to change PHP configurations to enhance container performance:
- By default, the `$PHP_*` environment variables only take effect when set before starting the container.
- To dynamically change PHP configurations using `$PHP_*` environment variables while running commands within the container,
you need to start your container with the `ALLOW_RUNTIME_PHP_ENVVARS=1` environment variable.

## [5.0.0] - 2024-02-15

We are thrilled to announce the rollout of updated Docker images (v5) built directly from the [official PHP Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php) to ensure you get the most up-to-date packages and bug fixes!

Check out the document and available tags on Docker Hub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/shinsenter/php
> The `-alpine` and `-tidy` tags are lightweight Alpine-based images to speed up your builds and save bandwidth.

These images are updated daily to stay current with the latest PHP, OS, and tooling updates for maximum freshness. We also apply stable version tags on a separate repo for dependable production images:
https://hub.docker.com/r/shinsenter/php-archives/tags

Old image versions (pre v5.x) now have `-deprecated` tags but will no longer receive updates. See them here:
https://hub.docker.com/r/shinsenter/php/tags?name=-deprecated
