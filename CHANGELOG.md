## [5.0.0] - 2024-02-15

We are rolling out updated Docker images based on the [official PHP Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php). We have taken steps to minimize the impact of this change on your existing setup.

We are using different Docker image tags to maintain the old Docker image versions. All old Docker images have been published with `*-deprecated` tag names. However, we will no longer provide any update for the old Docker images. https://hub.docker.com/r/shinsenter/php/tags?page=1&name=-deprecated
