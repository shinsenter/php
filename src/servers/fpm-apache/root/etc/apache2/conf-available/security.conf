# Changing the following options will not really affect the security of the
# server, but might make attacks slightly more difficult in some cases.

# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The default is 'Full' which sends information about the OS-Type
# and compiled in modules.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minimal | Minor | Major | Prod
# where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.
ServerTokens Prod

# Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host
# name to server-generated pages (internal error documents, FTP directory
# listings, mod_status and mod_info output etc., but not CGI generated
# documents or custom error documents).
# Set to "EMail" to also include a mailto: link to the ServerAdmin.
# Set to one of:  On | Off | EMail
ServerSignature Off

# Allow TRACE method
#
# Set to "extended" to also reflect the request body (only for testing and
# diagnostic purposes).
#
# Set to one of:  On | Off | extended
TraceEnable Off

# Forbid access to version control directories
#
# If you use version control systems in your document root, you should
# probably deny access to their directories. For example, for subversion:
<DirectoryMatch "/\.git">
   Require all denied
</DirectoryMatch>

# Prevent Apache from serving Jenkinsfile files
<FilesMatch "Jenkinsfile$">
   Require all denied
</FilesMatch>

# Prevent Apache from serving Gitlab files
<FilesMatch "\.gitlab-ci.yml$">
   Require all denied
</FilesMatch>

# Disable XML-RPC on all wordpress sites
<Files xmlrpc.php>
   Require all denied
# allow from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
</Files>

# Setting this header will prevent MSIE from interpreting files as something
# else than declared by the content type in the HTTP headers.
# Requires mod_headers to be enabled.
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: "nosniff"

# Setting this header will prevent other sites from embedding pages from this
# site as frames. This defends against clickjacking attacks.
# Requires mod_headers to be enabled.
Header always set X-Frame-Options: "sameorigin"

# Referrer policy
Header always set Referrer-Policy "no-referrer-when-downgrade"

# Content Security Policy
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' http: https: data: blob: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; frame-ancestors 'self';"

# Strict-Transport-Security Policy (set HSTS)
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains"
