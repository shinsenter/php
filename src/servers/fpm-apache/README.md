## About this project

🌏 (PHP) Production-ready Ubuntu + PHP-FPM + [Apache2](https://httpd.apache.org) Docker images with plenty of common and useful extensions for your PHP applications. These images are actively maintained.

> We also provide an easy and secure way to configure Apache2 with PHP-FPM, eliminating the hassle and potential security issues that come with other guides and tutorials.

> With these Docker images, you can easily [add more PHP modules](#enabling-or-disabling-php-modules) or [customize your Docker image](#customize-docker-image) to fit your specific needs.

> 💡 Streamline your project workflow and save storage space with our compact and versatile Docker images, boasting a lightweight download size of under 100MB without sacrificing on functionality.

## Usage

### Docker Pull command

```bash
docker pull shinsenter/phpfpm-apache:latest
```

or

```bash
docker pull shinsenter/phpfpm-apache:php${PHP_VERSION}
```

or

```bash
docker pull shinsenter/phpfpm-apache:php${PHP_VERSION}-tidy
```

### The document root

By default, your application will be placed in the `/var/www/html` directory of the Docker container, also known as the document root. However, if you want to change the location of your application, you can simply adjust the `WEBHOME` environment variable.

```Dockerfile
ENV WEBHOME="/var/www/html"
```

If you have your `index.php` file located in a `public` directory within your `$WEBHOME` path, you can also change the default document directory of Apache by using the `$APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT` environment variable.

```Dockerfile
ENV APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT="/public"
```

But don't forget, after changing this variable, you'll also need to update your default working directory in the Dockerfile. No worries, it's easy to do! Just add a couple of lines to the bottom of your Dockerfile and you're good to go:

```
# sets the working directory
WORKDIR $WEBHOME
```

### Composer

The latest version of Composer is installed and ready to use.

> Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP, written in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. You can read more about Composer in our [official documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc).

### Access to your container

Just open a terminal and run below command to access to your container:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```

### Enabling or disabling PHP modules

There are many [pre-installed PHP modules](https://code.shin.company/php#pre-installed-php-modules) in the `shinsenter/php` Docker images, and I think it is quite enough for different PHP projects. If you want to add/remove these modules here is the guide.

The `shinsenter/php` Docker images provide some helper scripts to more easily install/remove or enable/disable PHP extensions.
- `phpaddmod` (or `docker-php-ext-install`)
- `phpdelmod` (or `docker-php-ext-remove`)
- `phpenmod` (or `docker-php-ext-enable`)
- `phpdismod` (or `docker-php-ext-disable`)

#### Installing PHP modules:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> phpaddmod <module names, space-delimited list>
```

E.g.: `docker exec -it my-container phpaddmod imagick pgsql solr`

#### Removing PHP modules:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> phpdelmod <module names, space-delimited list>
```

E.g.: `docker exec -it my-container phpdelmod imagick pgsql solr`

### Composer command

Running a Composer command:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> composer <arguments>
```

E.g.: `docker exec -it my-container composer install`

### Docker Run command

```bash
docker run --rm [run options] shinsenter/phpfpm-apache <your_command>
```

For example:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/var/www/html -e PUID=$(id -u) -e PGID=$(id -g) shinsenter/phpfpm-apache composer dump-autoload
```

## Customize Your Docker Image

Easily change container configurations and tailor your image to your specific needs by utilizing pre-defined Docker environment variables.

Look no further than this `Dockerfile` sample for building your own custom image by extending the base image provided here.

> Want to learn more about how to create the ultimate custom image? Check out the [Dockerfile documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder) and start building today.

But that's not all - you can also add more [pre-defined Docker environment variables](https://code.shin.company/php#customize-docker-image) to change PHP-FPM behavior without copying configuration files to your containers.

```Dockerfile
ARG  PHP_VERSION=8.2
FROM shinsenter/phpfpm-apache:php${PHP_VERSION}

# ==========================================================

# you may want to install some PHP modules
# e.g: the following line will install imagick, pgsql, solr modules
RUN phpaddmod imagick pgsql solr

# ==========================================================

# Control your timezone
ENV TZ="UTC"

# sets GID and UID
ENV PUID=9999
ENV PGID=9999

# Sets the directory from which Apache will serve files
ENV WEBHOME="/var/www/html"

# Set Apache root folder within $WEBHOME
# E.g: APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT="/public"
ENV APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT=""

# Set to "true" to fix permission for whole $WEBHOME
ENV FIX_WEBHOME_PERMISSION="false"

# ==========================================================

# Sets the limit on the number of connections
# that an individual child server process will handle
ENV APACHE_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_CHILD="0"

# Sets the limit on the number of simultaneous requests that will be served
ENV APACHE_MAX_REQUEST_WORKERS="150"

# Maximum number of idle threads
ENV APACHE_MAX_SPARE_THREADS="75"

# Minimum number of idle threads to handle request spikes
ENV APACHE_MIN_SPARE_THREADS="10"

# Sets the number of child server processes created on startup
ENV APACHE_START_SERVERS="2"

# Set the maximum configured value for ThreadsPerChild
# for the lifetime of the Apache httpd process
ENV APACHE_THREAD_LIMIT="64"

# This directive sets the number of threads created by each child process
ENV APACHE_THREADS_PER_CHILD="25"

# Automatically create index.php
ENV AUTO_CREATE_INDEX_FILE="true"

# ==========================================================

# You can easily change PHP-FPM configurations
# by using pre-defined Docker's environment variables.
# Learn more: https://code.shin.company/php#customize-docker-image
```

Then run below command to build your Docker image.

```bash
docker build [build options] - < Dockerfile
```

## Docker Compose example

Create an empty directory for a new project and place in the directory a `docker-compose.yml` file with below content.

> Learn more about [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose).

> To configure an HTTPS server, you need to mount the directory of the server certificate `server.crt` and private key `server.key` files to container's `/etc/ssl/web` path. You can also use a modern HTTP reverse proxy like [Traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik).

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  phpfpm-apache-app:
    image: shinsenter/phpfpm-apache:latest
    volumes:
      - ./my-website:/var/www/html
      - ./ssl-certs:/etc/ssl/web
    environment:
      TZ: UTC
      PUID: ${UID:-9999}
      PGID: ${GID:-9999}
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    links:
      - db
      - redis

  ## OTHER CONTAINERS SUCH AS REDIS OR DATABASE ###################################
  db:
    image: mariadb:latest
    environment:
      TZ: UTC
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: mydb_p@ssw0rd
      MYSQL_DATABASE: my_database
    volumes:
      - "./db/data:/var/lib/mysql"
      - "./db/dump:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d"
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

Then run below command to start containers.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Supported platforms

Currently, the supported architectures are:

- linux/amd64
- linux/arm/v7
- linux/arm64/v8
- linux/ppc64le

> You do not need to use a platform-specific tag (although you can), Docker will automatically choose the appropriate architecture.
