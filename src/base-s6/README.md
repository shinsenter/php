## About this project

The images in this repository contain only unpacked [s6-overlay v3](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) as a multi-platform and reusable build stage.

The s6-overlay was built specifically for the lifecycle of containers, giving you a more accurate way of bringing containers down and monitoring their health.

These images are actively maintained.

## Usage

This repository is not intended to be used directly, but rather consumed in other Dockerfiles as a multi-platform and reusable build stage.

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# adds file from the shinsenter/s6-overlay image
COPY --from=shinsenter/s6-overlay / /

# important: sets s6-overlay entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["/init"]

# runs other commands
RUN ...
```

Then run below command to build your Docker image.

```bash
docker build [build options] - < Dockerfile
```

## My other projects

Most of my [other docker projects](https://docker.shin.company) are built on top of Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) with s6-overlay v3 using my Ubuntu docker base images:
