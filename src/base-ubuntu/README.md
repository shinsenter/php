## About this project

Are you tired of using the same old, basic Docker base images? Look no further than this repository, where you'll find the latest stable versions of [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) with added features for optimal container management. Not only do these images include the powerful [s6-overlay v3](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay/tree/v3), specifically designed for the lifecycle of containers, but they also come with [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) included.

Want to know more about why s6-overlay is the ultimate tool for container management? Check out the [explanation](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#the-docker-way) by the s6-overlay team.

And the best part? These images are actively maintained, ensuring that you're always using the most up-to-date version. Upgrade your Docker containers with ease.

## Customize Your Docker Image

Easily change container configurations and tailor your image to your specific needs by utilizing pre-defined Docker environment variables.

Look no further than this `Dockerfile` sample for building your own custom image by extending the base image provided here.

> Want to learn more about how to create the ultimate custom image? Check out the [Dockerfile documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder) and start building today.

```Dockerfile
FROM shinsenter/s6-ubuntu

# sets s6-overlay entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["/init"]

# Control your timezone
ENV TZ="UTC"

# sets GID and UID
ENV PUID=9999
ENV PGID=9999

# set ENABLE_CRONTAB=true to enable crontab
ENV ENABLE_CRONTAB=false
```

Then run below command to build your Docker image.

```bash
docker build [build options] - < Dockerfile
```

## Docker Compose example

Create an empty directory for a new project and place in the directory a `docker-compose.yml` file with below content.

> Learn more about [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose).

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  s6-ubuntu-app:
    image: shinsenter/s6-ubuntu:latest
    environment:
      TZ: UTC
      PUID: ${UID:-9999}
      PGID: ${GID:-9999}
```

Then run below command to start containers.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Supported platforms
