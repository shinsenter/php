# Responsible Disclosure Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously in our open-source project. If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us by responsibly disclosing it. We appreciate your efforts in keeping our project safe for everyone.

## How to Report a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability:

1. **Contact us privately**: Please email us at [shin@shin.company](mailto:shin@shin.company) with details about the vulnerability. Please refrain from disclosing the issue publicly until we've had a chance to address it.

2. **Provide details**: Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and its potential impact.

3. **Be responsible**: Please avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.

## What to Expect

Once we receive your report, we'll acknowledge it promptly. We'll work to assess the reported vulnerability's validity and severity and develop a fix as quickly as possible. We'll keep you updated on our progress throughout the process.

## Legal Safe Harbor

We won't take legal action against you for responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities in our project. We appreciate your contributions to making our project more secure.

Thank you for your help in keeping our project safe.
