## About this project

- Tired of waiting around for Docker images to build before you can start your website?
- Tired of customizing modules from official docker php images, or your docker image after installing more modules becomes too big?
- Tired of installing web sevrers like Apache or Nginx to run your PHP applications in the browser?

Not only you, but I also had those concerns when building environments for PHP applications. These jobs are quite boring and time consuming.

Therefore, based on my many years of experience, I created this project to help you quickly build an environment to run your PHP applications (regardless of whether it is a production or development environment).

Let's check it out!!

## Container OS

This project is built on top of my Docker base image, which is Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) with s6-overlay v3 and OpenSSL included. Learn more at: [shinsenter/s6-ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/r/shinsenter/s6-ubuntu).

## Usage

### Docker Pull command

```bash
docker pull shinsenter/php:${PHP_VERSION}-${PHP_VARIATION}
```

### Docker Compose example

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  my-container:
    image: shinsenter/php:${PHP_VERSION}-${PHP_VARIATION}

## Thank you [@serversideup](https://github.com/serversideup)

This project is inspired by the [serversideup/docker-php](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php) project, I love it.

However the owners seem to be quite busy updating their projects, so I made my own version.
