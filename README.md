## Introduction

[![shinsenter/php](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/458053748/5a05c8e4-1c00-440c-98f1-2cd4548bbaa2)](https://docker.shin.company/php)

Our PHP Docker images are based on the [official PHP Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php).
These images facilitate the easy adjustment of PHP and PHP-FPM settings using environment variables,
eliminating the need to rebuild images when making configuration changes.

These images also come with the latest version of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
and popular web servers like [Apache2](https://httpd.apache.org), [Nginx](https://nginx.org), [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev), [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev) or [Nginx Unit](https://unit.nginx.org).
This setup allows for faster project initiation without additional installations.

> 🪶 Info: While built on the official PHP images and including more useful extensions,
> we have **significantly reduced the image sizes** compared to the base images.
> This optimization improves download times and resource usage without sacrificing functionality,
> thanks to the [docker-squash](https://code.shin.company/docker-squash) project.


## Docker Image Variants

Our image tags cover PHP versions from 5.6 to 8.5 (beta),
available in `cli`, `zts`, `fpm`, `fpm-nginx`, `fpm-apache`, `roadrunner`<sup>(1)</sup>, `frankenphp`<sup>(2)</sup>, and `unit-php`<sup>(3)</sup> variants. The Docker images are available for both Debian and Alpine versions.

Examples:
- `shinsenter/php:7.2-cli`
- `shinsenter/php:7.3-zts`
- `shinsenter/php:7.4-fpm`

### Examples <!-- omit from toc -->

You can easily run a container by copying and pasting one of these `docker run` commands:


#### CLI <!-- omit from toc -->

```shell
# non-interactive
docker run --rm shinsenter/php:8.4-cli php -m

# interactive
docker run -it -v ./myproject:/var/www/html shinsenter/php:8.4-cli
```


#### PHP-FPM <!-- omit from toc -->

```shell
docker run -v ./myproject:/var/www/html -p 9000:9000 shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm
```


#### PHP-FPM + Nginx (or Apache, RoadRunner, FrankenPHP, Nginx Unit) <!-- omit from toc -->

```shell
# with Nginx
docker run -v ./myproject:/var/www/html -p 80:80 -p 443:443 shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm-nginx

# with Apache
docker run -v ./myproject:/var/www/html -p 80:80 -p 443:443 shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm-apache

# with RoadRunner
docker run -v ./myproject:/var/www/html -p 80:80 -p 443:443 shinsenter/php:8.3-roadrunner

# with FrankenPHP
docker run -v ./myproject:/var/www/html -p 80:80 -p 443:443 shinsenter/php:8.3-frankenphp

# with Nginx Unit
docker run -v ./myproject:/var/www/html -p 80:80 -p 443:443 shinsenter/php:8.3-unit-php
```


## Customizing Settings via Environment Variables

These images allow customizing PHP and PHP-FPM settings through environment variables instead of rebuilding images.

The environment variable names follow these conventions:
- Variables are prefixed with `PHP_` to avoid conflicts with other application variables.
- The rest of the variable name matches the configuration directive name from `php.ini` or `php-fpm.conf`:
    - PHP ini directives: https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php
    - PHP-FPM directives: https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php
- Directive names are converted to `CONSTANT_CASE` - uppercase with underscores instead of dots or dashes.

This naming convention helps you easily identify which environment variable applies to which PHP/PHP-FPM configuration directive.

> 👉🏻 Info: By default, the `$PHP_*` environment variables only take effect when set before starting the container.
> To dynamically change PHP configurations using `$PHP_*` environment variables while running commands within the container,
> you need to start your container with the `ALLOW_RUNTIME_PHP_ENVVARS=1` environment variable.

> 💡 Hint: Run `php-envvars` in the container to get a full list of default `$PHP_*` environment variables.

> 💡 Hint: Run `php-envvars` in the container to get a full list of default `$PHP_*` environment variables.


## Pre-installed PHP Extensions

Popular PHP extensions are pre-installed by default, allowing projects to get started faster without additional installation.

```list
apcu
bcmath
calendar
exif
gd
gettext
igbinary
intl
msgpack
mysqli
opcache
pcntl
pdo_mysql
pdo_pgsql
pgsql
redis
sodium
tidy
uuid
yaml
zip
```

> 👉🏻 Info: The pre-installed PHP extensions from the official Docker images are excluded from this list.

> 💡 Hint: Run `docker run --rm shinsenter/php:8.4-cli php -m` in the container
to get a list of extensions (you can replace `8.4` with a specific PHP version).


## Adding PHP Extensions

These images use a simple command called `phpaddmod` to install PHP extensions.

You don't need to run the more complex `docker-php-ext-install` command
or manually edit the `php.ini` file; `phpaddmod` handles the installation and configuration for you.

For example, in your `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm-nginx

# Install imagick, swoole and xdebug
RUN phpaddmod imagick swoole xdebug

# Add your instructions here
# For example:
# ADD --chown=$APP_USER:$APP_GROUP ./myproject/ /var/www/html/
```

> 👉🏻 Info: The `phpaddmod` command is a wrapper around the [`mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer`](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer) utility,
which takes care of all required steps to compile and activate the extensions.

> 💡 Hint: If you're having trouble figuring out which extensions can be installed,
have a look at [their documentation](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer/blob/master/README.md#supported-php-extensions).


## Application Directory

The default application directory is `/var/www/html` and can be customized via the `$APP_PATH` environment variable:

```shell
docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp \
    -v "$PWD":/app \
    -e APP_PATH=/app \
    shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm-nginx
```

This changes the web application directory to `/app`.

Moreover, the default document root
(a relative path inside the `$APP_PATH` (application directory) that contains your `index.php` file)
can be customized by setting the `$DOCUMENT_ROOT` environment variable:

```shell
docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp \
    -v "$PWD":/app \
    -e APP_PATH=/app \
    -e DOCUMENT_ROOT=public \
    shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm-nginx
```

This would change the document root path to `/app/public`.


## Customizing Container User and Group in Docker

Override the default user and group settings by setting environment variables when running the container.

Available variables:

| Environment Variable | Description                             | Default          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|
| `APP_USER`           | Username inside the container           | `www-data`       |
| `APP_GROUP`          | Group name inside the container         | `www-data`       |
| `APP_UID`            | Numeric UID of the user                 | UID in container |
| `APP_GID`            | Numeric GID of the group                | GID in container |

For example, to run a container as user `myapp` with UID `5000`:

```shell
docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 443:443/udp \
    -e APP_USER=myapp \
    -e APP_UID=5000 \
    shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm-nginx
```

Or in a `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm-nginx
    environment:
      APP_USER: "myapp"
      APP_UID: "5000"
```


## Hooks

Hooks are useful for customizing the behavior of a running container.<br/>
These images support the following hooks:

| Hook name   | Description                                          | Example usage              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `onboot`    | Runs when the container starts or restarts.          | Send startup notification. |
| `first-run` | Runs only the first time the container starts.       | Initialize database.       |
| `rebooted`  | Runs whenever the container restarts.                | Check crash logs.          |
| `migration` | Runs migration scripts.                              | Run DB migrations.         |
| `onready`   | Runs after `migration`, when the app is nearly ready.| Warm up caches.            |
| `onlive`    | Runs after the web server starts (if included).      | Trigger webhook.           |

To use hooks, create a `hooks` folder inside `$APP_PATH` and add executable files named after the hook, or in subfolders with the same name.
Example: to install PHP modules at `first-run`, add a script `hooks/first-run` or `hooks/first-run/install-modules`.

Set `DEBUG=1` to see which hooks are executed.


## Autorun Scripts

Shell scripts placed in the `/startup/` directory will automatically run when the container starts, in alphabetical order by filename.
This feature can initialize projects before the main program runs, saving time by executing initialization scripts automatically.


#### Usage Example <!-- omit from toc -->

Copy a script called `00-migration` into `/startup/` via a Dockerfile:

> Note: Ensure the script has executable permissions.

```Dockerfile
FROM shinsenter/php:8.4-cli

ADD ./autorun/00-migration /startup/00-migration
RUN chmod +x /startup/00-migration

# Add your instructions here
# For example:
# ADD --chown=$APP_USER:$APP_GROUP ./myproject/ /var/www/html/
```

> 👉🏻 Info: The startup directory already includes a script called `99-greeting` that prints a welcome message when the container starts.


#### Disable Autorun Scripts <!-- omit from toc -->

To disable autorun scripts, set `DISABLE_AUTORUN_SCRIPTS=1` as an environment variable.

For example, with `docker run`:

```shell
docker run -e DISABLE_AUTORUN_SCRIPTS=1 shinsenter/ubuntu-s6:latest bash
```

Or in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: shinsenter/ubuntu-s6:latest
    environment:
      DISABLE_AUTORUN_SCRIPTS: "1"
```


## Using Cron Jobs

> **Note**: This is a supporting feature. If you require more advanced capabilities beyond basic `crontab` functionality, please consider building your own Docker image and installing an alternative scheduling tool (e.g., [supercronic](https://github.com/aptible/supercronic)) that better suits your needs.

To enable cron jobs in containers, you can start the container with `ENABLE_CRONTAB=1`.
This setting activates the Crontab service, which loads settings from the directory specified by `$CRONTAB_DIR` (default is `/etc/crontab.d`).

The cron jobs will run as the user defined by `$APP_USER:$APP_GROUP`, which by default is `www-data:www-data`,
and with the home directory set by `$CRONTAB_HOME` (default is `/var/www/html`).

Here is an example Dockerfile to add a crontab:

```Dockerfile
FROM shinsenter/php:latest

ENV ENABLE_CRONTAB=1

# create crontab entry via RUN instruction
RUN echo '* * * * * echo "echo This line will run every minute!" | tee /tmp/cron-every-minute.txt' >> /etc/crontab.d/sample1;

# or copy crontab entries via ADD instruction
ADD ./sample2 /etc/crontab.d/
```

The format of a crontab entry is as follows:

```
# Job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  *  command to be executed
```

You can also easily set up cron jobs through the `$CRONTAB_SETTINGS` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
When the container starts, these settings are loaded into crontab, giving you more flexibility to change them later.

```yml
services:
  web:
    image: shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm-nginx
    environment:
      ENABLE_CRONTAB: "1"
      CRONTAB_SETTINGS: "* * * * * echo 'This line will run every minute!' | tee /tmp/cron-every-minute.txt"
```

For more information on environment variables for cron jobs, refer to the [Other System Settings](#other-system-settings) section below.


## Customize Supervisor Command

We can set a `$SUPERVISOR_PHP_COMMAND` environment variable to the service definition in your application's `docker-compose.yml` file.
This environment variable will contain the command that the container will use to serve your application using another process instead of the default process.


#### Command Line <!-- omit from toc -->

```shell
docker run \
    -e SUPERVISOR_PHP_COMMAND='php -S localhost:80 index.php' \
    shinsenter/php:8.4
```


#### With docker-compose.yml <!-- omit from toc -->

```yml
services:
  web:
    image: shinsenter/php:8.4
    environment:
      SUPERVISOR_PHP_COMMAND: "php -S localhost:80 index.php"
```


## Sending Emails

In these Docker images, `sendmail` has been replaced by `msmtp` for sending emails.
You can send emails using common PHP libraries like [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer).

If you prefer to use PHP's `mail()` function,
you'll need to configure SMTP using the following environment variables in your container:

| Environment Variable | Description                                     | Example Value        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `SMTP_HOST`          | The hostname or IP address of the SMTP server.  | `smtp.gmail.com`     |
| `SMTP_PORT`          | Port number used to connect to the SMTP server. | `587`                |
| `SMTP_LOG`           | File path to store SMTP email logs.             | `/path/to/email.log` |
| `SMTP_FROM`          | The sender's email address.                     | `admin@example.com`  |
| `SMTP_USER`          | Username used for SMTP authentication.          | `your_smtp_username` |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD`      | Password used for SMTP authentication.          | `your_smtp_password` |
| `SMTP_AUTH`          | Whether SMTP authentication is required.        | `on`                 |
| `SMTP_TLS`           | Whether to use TLS for secure connection.       | `on`                 |

> 💡 Hint: If you don't have an SMTP server available (like Gmail) to send emails,
> you can try using another container such as [Mailpit](https://hub.docker.com/r/axllent/mailpit) to act as an SMTP server.
>
> If you're using Mailpit, you only need to set the following two environment variables
> in your container: `SMTP_HOST=mailpit` and `SMTP_PORT=1025`.


## Debug Mode

Enable "debug mode" for more verbose logging by setting `DEBUG=1` as an environment variable.
This can be used both with `docker run` and in `docker-compose.yml`.


#### Command Line <!-- omit from toc -->

```shell
docker run -e DEBUG=1 shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm-nginx
```


#### With docker-compose.yml <!-- omit from toc -->

```yml
services:
  web:
    image: shinsenter/php:8.4-fpm-nginx
    environment:
      DEBUG: "1"
```


## Other System Settings

These Docker images include additional environment variables for fine-tuning container behavior:

| Setting Name                       | Default Value    | Description           | Example |
|------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------|
