# Contributions

## Interested in contributing?

As an open source project, we'd appreciate any help and contributions!

We follow the standard [github pull request process](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests). We'll try to review your contributions as soon as possible.

## File an Issue

Not ready to contribute code, but see something that needs work? While we encourage everyone to contribute code, it is also appreciated when someone reports an issue. We use [github issues](https://github.com/shinsenter/php/issues) for this.

From contributing to source code to improving readability of the documentation, all suggestions are welcome!
